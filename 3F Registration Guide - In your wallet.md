# **Registration Guide - In your wallet**
### This guide shows the wallet registration process using Daedalus as an example. Please refer to your specific wallet for related guides.

### **In your Daedalus wallet**
### STEP 1
In the latest version of Daedalus, navigate to the voting registration page from the menu on the left-hand side.
* Confirm that you have installed the Catalyst Voting app.
* Confirm that you hold at least 500 ADA at the time of the snapshot.
* Click on "Register to vote‚Äù

### STEP 2
Select the wallet you wish to vote with and click "Continue" (ensure the wallet contains the minimum required amount for voting: 500 ADA *excluding rewards*)

Note: This amount must remain in this wallet until the snapshot, which will collect your voting power. Dates and times of the snapshots for each Fund will be announced through our official social and communication channels

### STEP 3
Enter the spending password for your wallet or connect your Hardware wallet and click "Submit registration transaction":

### STEP 4
Wait for approximately 5 minutes until the transaction is confirmed by the blockchain and click "Continue". Do not close Daedalus during this time, otherwise your registration will be canceled and you will need to start over:

### STEP 5
Set a 4 digit PIN code of your choice, confirm it and click "Continue".

Please make sure to remember it or write it down as you will need it for voting later on. Note that if you lose the PIN you will not be able to vote and you will need to repeat the registration process to select a new PIN:

### STEP 6
Daedalus will generate a QR code that you will use on Catalyst App to complete the registration and to cast your votes.
* Click "Save as PDF" 
* Click "Save" in the dialog
* Note that if you don't save the QR code you wont be able to complete your registration and vote.

### STEP 7
Wait for the confirmation message "PDF successfully downloaded" and click on "Close".
