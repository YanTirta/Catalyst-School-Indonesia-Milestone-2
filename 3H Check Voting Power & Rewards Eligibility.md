# **Check Voting Power & Rewards Eligibility**

In Fund10, users will need to wait until voting starts to view voting power in the Catalyst mobile application. 

The Snapshot Module tool linked below allows users to connect a Catalyst registration in order to check voting power before voting begins, allowing users to validate and troubleshoot registration status before registration closes. 

Users will also get feedback on whether their registration is eligible to recieve voter rewards in Fund10. Remember - registrations submitted before Fund10 will be eligible to vote but not recieve rewards. Be sure to update registration and verify using the Snapshot Module!
