In the above response, there are only three archives available. Should the number of results exceed 50, they will automatically be paginated. This is made evident by the next field being set. To fetch subsequent archives, you would call the same endpoint and append ?next={VALUE} where VALUE is the value of the next field. To iterate over all available archives, you can repeat this process until the next field is empty.
