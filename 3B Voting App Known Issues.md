| Issue | Impact | 
|:--:|:--|
|Rounding ComRev scoring data|Community Review scoring data is using the star rating system logic to round aggregated scores for each of the 3 criteria without decimal points, except for a score of 4.5 |
|Formatting|Some users may experience inconsistent or odd formatting on certain pages, such as the relevant team experience section|
|Navigation of randomized sorting|When users apply the (default) “randomize” sorting option, then clicking the arrows to navigate between proposals will cause the number to change randomly, rather than incrementing by 1|  
|Navigation bar items|Navigation bar items may appear misplaced for iPhone users|
|Voting has ended message|Once voting ends, some users may see their voting power replaced by asterisks (“***”) rather than being replaced by the appropriate message|
